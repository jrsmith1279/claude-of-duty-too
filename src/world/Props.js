/**
 * Everything in the world that is not the building shell.
 *
 * The blockout renders correctly and is completely empty, and emptiness — not
 * shader quality — is what loses a blind comparison against a real Call of Duty
 * frame. `docs/CRITIC_RUBRIC.md` fails a shot outright for a bare ground plane;
 * `docs/ART_DIRECTION.md` lists eight density rules and the blockout satisfies
 * none of them. This system is the fix, and it is organised around the two
 * budgets that actually constrain the answer.
 *
 * **Draw calls, not triangles.** 350 budget, 178 spent by the shell, and a
 * shadow caster costs one draw per cascade on top of its own. So no prop is
 * ever its own mesh: `BatchSet` merges everything into buffers keyed by
 * material x spatial zone x casts-shadow. Ten thousand pieces come out as a few
 * dozen draws, each still frustum-culled to a 30 m band of street.
 *
 * **Placement must outlive the level.** `Level.js` belongs to another agent and
 * is expected to be rewritten. Nothing here knows a single map coordinate:
 * `Site` surveys the world at init through `ctx.physics.raycast` and hands back
 * walkable ground, a distance transform to the nearest obstruction, exposed
 * facade segments and rooftop rectangles. Every module places against those.
 *
 * Published API:
 * ```js
 * ctx.props = {
 *   root,                  // THREE.Group, added to the scene
 *   setDensity(0..1),      // hides the optional detail tiers, instantly
 *   density,               // current value
 *   stats,                 // { pieces, decals, draws, ... }
 *   site,                  // the survey, for anything that wants to place things
 * }
 * ```
