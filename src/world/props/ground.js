/**
 * The edge of the road.
 *
 * `Level.js` lays each pavement as a single box, so the street currently meets
 * the carriageway along one perfectly straight, perfectly clean, perfectly
 * continuous extruded lip. That silhouette is a strong tell on its own — but
 * the bigger loss is everything the real edge collects. In every reference
 * frame the most detailed 60 cm of the whole street is the strip against the
 * kerb: laid granite units with open joints and at least one broken corner, a
 * band of silt and grit that the wheels never sweep, and a gully every twenty
 * metres with a dark opening and a damp halo round it. None of that existed.
 *
 * **Nothing here knows a map coordinate.** The kerb line is *derived* from the
 * survey: any pair of adjacent open cells whose floor heights differ by more
 * than 60 mm has a kerb face between them, and the outward normal points from
 * the high cell to the low one. Runs of those faces sharing a normal are
 * chained into lines. Hard-coding "the kerb is at x = +/-7" would be shorter
 * and would be wrong the next time the level agent moves a pavement, which is
 * precisely the failure mode `Site` exists to prevent. It also means this
 * module lights up automatically on any future raised platform, loading bay or
 * kerbed traffic island without another line of code.
 *
 * **Draw cost: zero.** Every piece goes into a bucket that already exists —
 * `concrete_floor` (shadowed) and `dirt` (unshadowed) in `core`, `gravel` in
 * `fine`, and the decal carrier key `gun_polymer` in the two decal sets. The
 * budget is fill-bound, not submission-bound, so more triangles inside an
 * existing bucket are close to free and are exactly the right thing to spend.
